Chapter 48: Arjuna weds Subhadra

 

Arjuna during his rounds of the pilgrim spots reached the sacred place named Pravasa. There he heard that the marriage of Subhadra, sister of Balarama and Krishna, was being contemplated. Balarama had decided to give her in marriage to Duryodhana. Arjuna had an eye on Subhadra. With the intention of winning Subhadra, he entered Dvaraka in the guise of a Tridandi sage. In his own interest, he stayed there for twelve months. He impressed everyone including Balarama who could not see through the disguise.
 
Balarama took a liking for the sage and invited him for food one day. Arjuna enjoyed the delicacies served and his eyes were all the time looking for Subhadra. As if in answer to his wishes, he chanced to see the pretty woman, when cupid, the love god, overpowered him. Subhadra too was attracted by the handsome personality of Arjuna. She discreetly conveyed her mind by her side glances and smiles.
 

 Arjuna weds Subhadra
 
Arjuna’s infatuation for her had robbed his peace of mind. Luckily, a convenient situation arose making it possible for him to elope with her. The festivities during the propitiation of a deity brought Subhadra out of the fort in a chariot. Availing the opportunity, he carried away his love bird with the prior permission of Krishna and Vasudeva. Majestically driving the chariot, he skillfully opposed those who challenged him. Balarama was furious at Arjuna for thwarting his plans. He was however pacified by Krishna’s entreaties along with other revered people. Having calmed down, Balarama realised nothing untoward had happened for he too was favourably disposed to Arjuna. He happily performed the marriage of his sister with lots of gifts and presents.
