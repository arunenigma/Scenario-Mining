Chapter 25: Putana and infant Krishna

 

Kamsa was somehow convinced by the asura allies on the necessity for killing all ten day old infants. Putana, the demoness, was sent on this errand. She roamed to various cities hunting on the lives of new born infants.
 
Disguised as a young woman, she entered the palace of king Nanda. The cowherd women were stunned by her extraordinary beauty. She found a charming child in a cradle. The child was the baby secretly left by Vasudeva with Nanda, the eighth child of Devaki. He was named Krishna. Unaware of the divine origin, the child was like any other infant to Putana. Krishna recognised the demoness and closed his eyes pretending to be asleep. Putana placed the child on her lap. She smeared a virulent poison on her breast so that he would die as soon as he was put to suck. Contrary to her expectation, Krishna began to suck with great force causing unbearable pain to the rakshasi. Shouting fiercely, she tried to push him away from her bosom but the small child persisted in sucking till her life was sucked out. When she died, she went back to the demoniac form. The dreadful person scared the cowherd women who were previously lost in her beauty on her arrival.
 

 Putana Killed
 
This incident reflects the two great qualities of God. He cannot allow the perpetration of evil. Secondly, he is generous towards wicked people even if they have just one merit to their credit. Putana met her death for her wicked intentions. She was also sent to heaven as she had suckled him like a mother. Krishna sucked her sins and purified her to deserve the honour of a mother.
